# ROUTINES
  ./run.sh: core program for event number calculation & minimization
  ./minimize_dchi2.sh: for minimization, scanning input CP phase
  ./chi2_oab_all.sh: for Fig.9 in Oki paper
  ./chi2_oabfar_all.sh: for Fig.7,8 in Re-evaluation paper

# OLD ROUTINES (NOT USED ANYMORE)
  ./job_dchi2.sh: for minimization, scanning ndiv points on dCP
  ./job_fig8.sh: minimization for different detector, OAB, MH and dCP
                 output datat for Fig.8 in Oki paper 

# HOW TO RUN
1. basic mode
   ./run.sh [run_name] [run_mode] [display] [mail]
   run_mode: 1:Serial mode 2:Parallel mode
   display: 0: don't display the shell output 1:display the output
   mail: 0:don't send a notification mail when a job is finished 1:send

2. dchi2 minimization mode
   ./minimize_dchi2.sh [run_name] [mail]


# Cautions
  13.MAY.31: accuracy of fiitting parameter should be less than that
  	     of corresponding true parameter. Otherwise minimization
	     routine shows numerical instability.

  13.Jun.01: sin(2th_atm)^2 in ithatm=1 or sin(2th_23)^2 in thatm=2 
   	     should be < 0.99. Otherwise, the diagonalization routine
             fails and returns disordered eigenvalues (i.e., lam(2) and 
	     lam(3) are flipped). 

# Version history  
Version 1.1
  14.Mar.14: NC events are decomposed w.r.t. the interaction mode (NCQE,NCRS,NCDI,NCCO/NCDF)
Version 1
  14.Mar.7: pull factor and DeltaChi^2_min output routine added
